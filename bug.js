This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's a common error in JavaScript, but can be particularly tricky in React Native because of asynchronous operations and data fetching.

```javascript
// Example code with the error
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
